# Divisibility Introduction

- Introduction and syllabus
- Introduction to CoCalc (one of your homeworks for Wednesday)
    - Accept your invitation
    - Look into the "Number Theory Project", find the "SampleLaTeXPage folder" and go in it.
    - Click on the "SampleLaTeXPage.tex" file to view it. Do NOT edit it.
    - Source code on left, resulting PDF on right. Scroll through the source code and compare with the output in order to learn how to mark certain documents.
    - Open the project in a new window. Go into the "chapter 1" folder. Open the "SolutionsDay1.tex" file.
    - Add a new section with your name in the title. If you find other's sections there, place yours relative to theirs according to the order of the problems you each have.
    - State the theorem or exercise you were assigned to do, then its solution.
- Definition: What are the **natural numbers**?
- Definition: What are the **integers**? How can we define the integers using the natural numbers?
- Definition: When do we say that an integer $d$ **divides** another integer $a$? How do we denote it?
    - Provide examples.
- Think of edge cases:
    - Does an integer divide itself?
    - What integers does 1 divide? What integers divide 1?
    - What integers does 0 divide? What integers divide 0?
- Definition: When do we say that two integers $a$, $b$ are **congruent modulo** another integer $d$?
    - Provide examples.
- Think of edge cases:
    - When is an integer congruent to itself?
    - When is an integer congruent to 0?
    - When is an integer congruent to its negative?
