# Midterm 3 Study Guide

1. Be able to do general versions of the following:
    a. Determine the last digit in the decimal expansion of $23^{123}$.
    b. Show that ${17}^{24} - {36}^{12}$ is divisible by $11$.
    c. Find all solutions to the equation $5x=10\mod 35$ and the equation $5x=6\mod 21$.
    d. Find the order of various elements modulo a prime.
    e. Determine if a number $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo a prime $p$.
    f. Compute $g$ and $T(a,p)$.
2. State in mathematical terms and either prove or provide a counterexample:
    a. Every natural number is congruent, modulo $n$, to exactly one number from $\{0,1,2,\ldots, n-1\}$
    b. Any set of $n$ integers, any two of which are incogruent modulo $n$, forms a *complete residue system* modulo $n$.
    c. If modulo $n$ a number $a$ has order $3$ and a number $b$ has order $5$, then their product $ab$ must have order dividing $15$.
    d. If modulo $n$ a number $a$ has order $3$ and a number $b$ has order $5$, then their product $ab$ must have order $15$.
    e. For every natural numbers $a$ and $n$ there is a positive integer $k$ such that $a^k=1\mod n$.
    f. For every natural numbers $a$ and $n$ there are distinct positive integers $k,j$ such that $a^k=a^j\mod n$.
    g. If two numbers are inverses modulo $n$, then they must have the same order.
3. State and prove:
    a. The various parts of theorem 3.24 about the solution to the equation $ax=b\mod n$.
    b. Theorems 3.27 and 3.28 about simultaneous solution to two congruence equations (chinese remainder theorem).
